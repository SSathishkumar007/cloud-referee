This project was built using Kiro for:

- Initial architecture planning
- Comparing cloud services (Lambda vs EC2, Firebase vs Supabase)
- Generating comparison logic and UI structure
- Debugging edge cases

Example prompt used in Kiro:

"Compare AWS Lambda and EC2 based on cost, scalability, latency, and operational overhead for a startup-scale application."
